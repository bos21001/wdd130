        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Most of all people love taking pictures, some of them even pay for it, especially during important events,
            such as marriage, a newborn in the family or pregnancy, graduation, and so on. Have you ever thought of
            paying a photographer but don't know if it is worth spending your money? My website will serve as a
            portfolio for my sister-in-law, a skilled and talented photographer. To prove to you it is worth spending
            your money on it. I want to help her engage with her public and get more clients. The website will show all
            her shots and short videos. I know everyone will love it.</p>


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Most of the people who will open this page will come from the NOW Photo Instagram profile. They are from 16
            to 40 years old. Most of them already had seen posts of the pictures on Instagram, but they are looking for
            more. Most of the followers are women. The audience will be women, from 16 to 40. More pictures from NOW
            Photo will be shown, and an easy place to find more information about contacting to talk directly to the
            photographer.</p>

            <strong>“About us” content</strong>
            <br><br>

            The index page will have a brief description of Nubia’s career to have a better with possible clients and
            old clients and family. Another brief description of her family and inspirations with pictures of them.

            This site is a result of family, love, and arduous work. I love the meaning of the logotype NOW which stands
            for Nubia, Oliver, and Willyan, the name of my sister-in-law’s family. “N” for Nubia herself, “O” for Oliver
            her son who is my first nephew and “W” for Willyan her husband who is my brother. The main character of this
            family company is Nubia who oversees everything and plays all the roles for the effectiveness of the
            company, from finding more clients to organizing the scenario and taking the shots. Oliver and Willyan are
            the inspiration and motivation for all this work.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?</strong>
            <br><br>

            Because of the simplicity and originality of the site, of all its story behind and the sympathy shown by the
            focus on people and not on money. I hope everyone can feel and see this family's serious business
            environment they got. Also, how much love, originality, quality, and desire to give the best to their client
            are given in all the shots shown on the site.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Site goal</strong>
            <br><br>

            The website in its essence will be simple and direct. Simplicity is the charm of the whole thing, because of
            the focus on pictures, people and their story. People may ask why it is so simple, why it does not have the
            price of the services or promotions ads. All the questions can be answered in the site content, or the user
            can directly talk to the photographer.

            <strong>What types of activity will people want to complete on the site?</strong>
            <br><br>

            A simple and intuitive gallery will be shown to sustain the main purpose and strategy of the site. The
            pictures will be separated by the individuals' stories and a short text when clicking with more pictures and
            a text or a series of text telling how the experience behind the scenes was. A brief account of what the
            people in the pictures felt when looking at their pictures, specifically their emotions and memories related
            will be shown to make it as original as possible.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Site strategy</strong>
            <br><br>

            To catch the attention of the curious eyes to show them there is more than just the pictures on the
            Instagram posts. The purpose of the site is to bring more clients by showing confidence and quality in every
            aspect, but especially in the pictures themselves. The site and its design must emphasize the purpose by
            giving focus on the pictures and the essence of the work.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Why will people come to the site?</strong>
            <br><br>

            Several people will come to the site to simply see how the progress of this family company is going, such as
            friends and old clients. Almost everyone will come to visit the site after looking at the posts made in the
            official NOW Photos Instagram profile, but also through the clients posting pictures mentioning the official
            profile. Most of everyone won’t quickly look for prices because they are simply curious of what more can
            have in store after all they have seen in the Instagram grid of their friends.

            <strong>What questions will people be answered on the site?</strong>
            <br><br>

            After checking by themselves how professional and organized is the work made by NOW Photos, probably they
            will want to know about prices that won’t be explicit on the site, so an easy place to contact information
            must be visible to everyone who is in the site. Options will be given for contact to let them feel free to
            reach the photographer with the best means of communication. The options will be WhatsApp, Telegram,
            Instagram and email. A choice of where they found the site will be asked to help gather data, and a choice
            to type a text in the site to automatically add into their message will be present, if possible, in each
            means of communication.
