                    <p>
                        Let me introduce you Little James and his parents.
                        Foremost, this beautiful baby loves taking pictures and
                        his amazing parents. Debora is his mom, Alisson his dad.
                        I've been blessed to spend an afternoon talking and
                        hearing from this family. Little James even being hungry
                        through the shoot section showed his kind smile for us
                        several times. How I love being close to a so special
                        family!

                        "We can tell you all how professional and human Nubia
                        was during this section of pictures. She has great
                        tactics and natural skills of calling the attention of
                        our baby which made us impressed and happy. We were
                        afraid of Little James being scared or shy, but this did
                        not happen. I feel I have another friend, not just a
                        photographer to take our pictures."

                    <p class="content_box_p_2"> Babies are my passion. My little
                        Oliver brings light to my life, and so do Little James
                        with these pictures! </p>

                        Marriages for sure delight me in a way I can't express
                        myself with words. Thifany and Robert are so original
                        and they chose a special spot for post-wedding pictures.
                        They told me how incredible was to get married inside
                        this temple of their religion, we spent some time
                        talking about life and how we are grateful for living.
                        They showed me with those pictures the gratitude they
                        got in life.

                        know how she loves recording moments. I didn't know how
                        this gift could be maximized by the work and kindness of
                        Nubia. She brought her baby and husband with her. They
                        were the most impressive team workers. Even Oliver
                        helped to allow the environment to be more soft and
                        natural."
